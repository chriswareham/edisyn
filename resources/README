This directory contains various auxiliary resources that you might find
useful in conjunction with certain Edisyn patch editors.

KawaiK1.iD8.RimSnare.syx
This is default patch iD8 on the Kawai K1, K1m, and K1r. Edisyn uses slot iD8 as a "scratch slot" because the K1 has no mechanism for sending patches, only for writing them.  If you needed the original patch after Edisyn had obliterated it, here it is.

Matrix1000Banks.zip
These are the default patches 000 through 199 of the Matrix 1000, in case you
had lost them. 

NovationSLMKIIDefaults.zip
These are the default templates (patches) for the Novation SL MKII, though these aren't particularly useful any more.

VenomPatches.zip
These are a collection of M-Audio Venom patches, originally in proprietary
Vyzex format, converted to sysex for use in Edisyn.

DX7.zip
This contains two files, dx7.patchparams and dx7.header.  The file dx7.patchparams is a textual list of over 30,000 unique DX7 patches culled from the internet.  dx7.header is a text file which gives information about this list.  We developed this collection to build the neural network for the DX7 hill-climber; it might be useful to other researchers.  Additionally, Edisyn's DX7 patch editor is capable of reading individual lines cut and pasted from the dx7.patchparams file.

EmuInstruments.zip
Various E-Mu synthesizers require a custom mapping from the instrument number to an offset in RAM in order to be properly referenced in sysex.  You can get this information via a special instrument sysex dump request.  This zip file contains instrument offset dumps for the Planet Phatt, Orbit V2, Carnaval, and Vintage Keys Plus synthesizers. 

Rev2FactoryBanks.zip
The upper four banks of the Sequential Rev2 cannot be written unless you turn on a special feature in Edisyn.  For people who have written to these banks and need to restore the originals (which are just copies of the original lower four banks), here is a bulk sysex file.
