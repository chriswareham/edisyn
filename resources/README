This directory contains various auxiliary resources that you might find
useful in conjunction with certain Edisyn patch editors.

KawaiK1.iD8.RimSnare.syx
This is default patch iD8 on the Kawai K1, K1m, and K1r. Edisyn uses slot iD8 as a "scratch slot" because the K1 has no mechanism for sending patches, only for writing them.  If you needed the original patch after Edisyn had obliterated it, here it is.

Matrix1000Banks.zip
These are the default patches 000 through 199 of the Matrix 1000, in case you
had lost them. 

NovationSLMKIIDefaults.zip
These are the default templates (patches) for the Novation SL MKII, though these aren't particularly useful any more.

VenomPatches.zip
These are a collection of M-Audio Venom patches, originally in proprietary
Vyzex format, converted to sysex for use in Edisyn.

DX7.patchparams
These aren't patches, but rather a collection of the *parameters*, in text, from almost 30,000 unique DX7 patches from the internet, stripped of their names.  We developed this collection to build the neural network for the DX7 hill-climber; it might be useful to other researchers.  The patches are one to a line, comma-separated, and the order of the parameters is the standard DX7 parameter order.  If you don't know what that is, see the array of strings edisyn.synth.yamahadx7.YamahaDX7.allParameters (minus the "name1" ... "name10")
