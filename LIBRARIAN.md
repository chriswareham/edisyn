# Librarian Support

NOTE: The Librarian is not present in the current build.  It'll show up in the coming build.

Edisyn's librarian is in its very early stages, and I can only test it on certain machines here and there.  If you'd like to assist in testing, I would be greatful -- just report errors on github or mail me directly (sean@cs.gmu.edu).
