<h1>Roland U-110</h1> 
<h2>Patch Editor</h2>

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as the synth's Control Channel.  Turn ON Program Change and Exclusive. 

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>The U-110 doesn't seem to respond to requests to download individual patches: so Edisyn must change the patch to the given patch (loading it into current memory) and then request the patch from current memory.
<p><li>Incredibly, Roland's sysex specification is missing almost everything needed to write the editor, so much had to be reverse engineered.  If you'd like to see a working specification, see the comments at the end of Edisyn's RolandU110.java file.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Librarian Support</h3>

Edisyn's U-110 editor (unlike the U-220 editors) supports bulk downloads from the machine, and in fact has a dedicated menu option in the Librarian to ask the machine to send it a bulk dump, which is much faster than Edisyn asking for each patch one by one.  Try it out, it's called <b>Request Bank from Synth</b>.

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>
Thanks to Keith (llamamusic@hotmail.com) for his extraordinary service in loaning stuff, providing materials, and debugging.  Thanks also to Ray Bellis for verifing the U-110's lack of sysex specification information.
