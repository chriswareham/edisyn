Using NRPN,"The Hydrasynth has extensive but rather buggy NRPN support.  
0. You'll need to turn on NRPN RX at least.
 1. Be aware that if you send the full complement of NRPN parameters, in order to update most of a patch say, the Hydrasynth cannot process them fast enough and is likely to drop several of those parameters on the floor.  Inserting pauses to slow things down will be tricky.  If you attempt this, you should first update all the modes (osc, mutant, ribbon, and voice glide), then all the types (osc, filter, fx), then all the LFO waves, then all the BPM syncs (delay, lfo, env, vibrato), then all the wavescan waves, and finally the remaining parameters.  You'll need at least 2ms pauses after mod matrix and macro parameters (4ms on the Deluxe).  And even then it won't be enough.

2. The Hydrasynth unhelpfully spits NRPN at you in response to many NRPN changes you make.  There's no way to shut it up short of turning off NRPN TX.

3. The Hydrasynth is missing NRPN for a number of parameters, and its scale parameters (scale type, notes, lock, etc.) actually send individual scale notes rather than the scale etc., which is profoundly unhelpful to the point of useless and problematic.",,

IMPORTANT NOTE 1.  If a line is blank, look for the first numbered version of that parameter.  For example, lfo5step14 is blank: instead you should see lfo1step1.

IMPORTANT NOTE 2.  Often this column refers to a table written in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES: for example osc1type below (row 10) refers to OSC_WAVES.  You can find these tables in Edisyn's ASMHydrasynth.java file."
