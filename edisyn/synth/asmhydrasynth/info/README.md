This directory contains useful information I have gathered during the process
of working on the Edisyn Hydrasynth editor.  It includes:

	- bugs.txt:  A list of significant bugs, errors, and misfeatures
	  I have discovered in the Hydrasynth and have reported.

	- nrpn.xlsx: A spreadsheet of many NRPN parameters with correct
	  information on their NRPN ranges and how to display them properly.
	  The existing PDF file provided by ASM is quite wrong in many
	  places and does not provide any display information at all.  Mine
	  attempts to remedy that.

	- nrpn.pdf: a PDF printout of the spreadsheet for people who can't
	  open xlsx files.

	- nrpn.tables.txt: The nrpn.xlsx/nrpn.pdf files often refer to
	  tables in ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.  These can be found in the
	  ASMHydrasynth.java file but they can also be found here.
