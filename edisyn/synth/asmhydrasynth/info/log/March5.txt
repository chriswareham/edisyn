March 5, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

The first four bytes of the payload appear to be an
obfuscated CRC32 checksum of the rest of the payload.

Take for example the payload  	19 DB 63 91 04 00 00 7F

0. Separate the 4 bytes from the rest of the string

	19 DB 63 91
	(vs) 04 00 00 7F

1. Compute the standard CRC-32 checksum on the string.

	CRC232(04 00 00 7F) --> 6E 9C 24 E6

2. Reverse it (perhaps it's different-endian?)

	E6 24 9C 6E

3. Subtract each value from FF

	FF-E6 = 19
	FF-24 = DB
	FF-9C = 63
	FF-6E = 91

4. That's the 4 bytes: 19 DB 63 91

BTW the remaining payload string in this example is, I think:

	04	Request Dump Command [I believe]
	00	Unknown
	00	Bank number 
	7F	Patch number

This works for the small messages. I haven't yet tested on the big ones.
