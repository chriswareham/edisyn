April 23, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

Writing patches wasn't writing LFO step values 9...64, Env triggers, and
Arp Step Offset among other things.  This was mystifying until it was
discovered that four magic numbers must be set.  The bytes are numbers
1766, 1767, 1768, and 1769, and in some patches they are set to 69 84 67 68,
while in other patches they're set to 88 88 88 88.  It's not clear why.
It appears that setting them to 69 84 67 68 will cause the hydrasynth to read
all its parameters properly.
