<h1>ASM Hydrasynth</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor should work properly with the Hydrasynth Keyboard, Deluxe (when set up right), Desktop, and Explorer.  It can read 1.5.5 and 2.0.0 sysex dumps and can write 2.0.0.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br> 

If you're connecting via USB, set Edisyn's incoming and outgoing MIDI devices to HYDRASYNTH KB.  Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as the synth's RX and TX MIDI channels.  You can set the synth's RX MIDI channel to OMNI if you liked.   Set up Parameter RX and TX both to be NRPN.  

<p><b>Current Editor Status</b><br>
ASM won't open their sysex spec: developing Edisyn required reverse engineering it.  As such Edisyn can do most things you'd need, but a few items (such as requesting current memory) are still out of reach.

<p><b>About the Hydrasynth Deluxe</b><br>
The Deluxe requires that NRPN be sent to it somewhat slower than the Keyboard.  So if you have a Deluxe, </b>be sure to check the "Deluxe" menu option.</b>

<p>Edisyn does not yet support the Deluxe's multimode, though I intend to ultimately.

<p><b>About the Menu</b><br>

<ul>
<li><b>Hydrasynth Deluxe</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it possible for Edisyn to properly send NRPN to the Deluxe (which is a little pokey compared to other Hydrasynths) and thus Send to Current Patch.  Make sure to check it if you have a Deluxe.

<p><li><b>Ignore Parameters from Synth</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;When you set various parameters in Edisyn (such as BPM Sync), the Hydrasynth rather unhelpfully will send its current settings to Edisyn, changing the settings you had made.  To deal with this, by default Edisyn ignores all incoming NRPN messages from your Hydrasynth.  If you'd like to make real-time changes to Edisyn by ahcnging values on the Hydrasynth, uncheck this option.

<p><li><b>Disallow CC Mutation</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;CC (and CV) options dominate the Hydrasynth's Mod Matrix Source and Destination lists, so mutation will select a CC or CV with a good probability, and you probably don't want that.  Selecting this menu prevents CC and CV options from being randomly selected during mutation.  As an alternative, you could simply disable the entire Mod Matrix category's mutable parameters (see the manual).  You might do this for the Macros as well.

<!--
<p><li><b>Send Arp Tap Trig</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Hydrasynth has a bug regarding the Arp Tap Trig option.  If you turn on or off this option via NRPN, the Hydrasynth will <i>also</i> turn on/off the Arpeggiator.  This doesn't happen if you turn Arp Tap Trig on or off on the front panel.  As a result, if you send a patch that has Arp Tap Trig turned on, it could turn the arpeggiator on, which you probably didn't intend.  By default Edisyn does not send Arp Tap Trig at all.  If you would like to send it (to send a final version of a patch in order to save it, say), and realize that you'll have to keep an eye on the Arpeggiator switch, you can check the <b>Send Arp Tap Trig</b> menu option. 
-->

<p><li><b>Lock User LFO Steps to Notes</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to restrict LFO steps to notes only when you change Edisyn's dials, you can check this.  This does not restrict LFO steps to notes in any other situation, even when receiving NRPN from the Hydrasynth.

<p><li><b>Lock All LFO Steps to Notes</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;If you would like to restrict LFO steps to notes only in all cases, you can check this.  This will restrict to notes when you change dials, randomize, morph, hill-climb, blend, nudge, merge, load files, and even receive parameters from the Hydrasynth.  Additionally if the Hydrasynth sends you a new patch, and this is turned on, then the steps will be modified so that they are restricted.  You probably only want to set this temporarily prior to a mutation operation such as randomization, morphing, hill-climbing, nudging, blending, and merging, so you can restrict mutation to just notes: you can then then turn it off again.  You almost certainly don't want it on when you load or save a patch.  For this reason, this option is not retained and is always reset when you create a new patch editor window.
</ul>

<p><b>Parameters that Can't Be Sent to Current Memory</b><br>

There are a number of parameters that can't be sent via NRPN to the Hydrasynth, and likewise cannot be sent to current memory.  They can be written to a patch in RAM however. They are:

<ul>
<li>Patch Name, Category, and Color
<p><li>Scale Type, Keyboard Lock, and Custom Notes
<p><li>Ribbon Scale Type, Ribbon Keyboard Lock, and Ribbon Custom Notes
<p><li>Ribbon Mod Hold
<p><li>Filter 1 Vowel Order (though the Hydrasynth will emit this)
<p><li>Arpeggiator Tempo (though the Hydrasynth will emit this), Clock Lock, Latch, and Step Offset
<p><li>All Macro Names and Macro Button States
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas and Hydrasynth Bugs to Be Aware of</b><br>

The Hydrasynth has a great many bugs: but Edisyn tries to work around them and hide them as best it can.  A few are still exposed and mentioned here, plus some general gotchas.

<ul>
<li>Yes, Envelope 2 really doesn't have modifiable a Trigger Source 1.

<p><li>In 2.0.0, the Hydrasynth does not emit Voice Vibrato Amount values less than 1.3 via NRPN.  It's a bug.

<p><li>The Envelope's Attack Curve labeling is incorrect: negative values should are actually LOG and positive values are actually EXP.  Edisyn follows the Hydrasynth's incorrect labelling.  I do not know if ASM mislabeled the attack knob by accident or intentionally because they imagined people wouldn't understand exponential curves: but it is wrong.  An exponential envelope curve doesn't mean it's increasing with an exponential rate of speed. It means that there is an <i>exponential dropoff</i> in the absolute rate of change.  For the decay/release, we start by moving very fast, and then as we approach the target we exponentially slow down (go horizontal).  Similarly for attack, we start by moving very fast (this time upwards), then as we approach the target we again slow down (go horizontal).  The Attack Curve knob behavior is identical to the Decay and Release knobs and should have been labelled the same. 

<p><li>Certain individual parameter changes will cause the Hydrasynth to foolishly respond with its current settings for a set of parameters.  This in turn will cause Edisyn to update those parameters, erasing any changes you may have made but not yet sent. This is unlikely to bite you, but you should be aware of it.   You can prevent this entirely by selecting <b>Ignore Parameters from Synth</b> in the Hydrasynth menu.

<p><li>Sometimes when the Hydrasynth wakes up from going to sleep, sending it parameter values from Edisyn will cause it to update those values with an offset (and thus incorrectly).

<p><li>The Hydrasynth has repurposed the <i>very important</i> CC 120 (All Sounds Off) to be used as Arp Octave.

<p><li>When you update the Mod Matrix or any Macro Assignments in Edisyn, the Hydrasynth does not update its display to reflect this.  You have to page away and come back to see the updates properly displayed.

<p><li>The first WaveScan wave goes Sin...Harmon23.  The other waves go Off, Silence, Sin, ... Harmon23.  This means that when you use the Category's distribute procedure to distribute waves, it won't work right for the first wave.

<p><li>You can't set the LFO Steps parameter unless the corresponding LFO Wave parameter has been first set to "Step".  You <i>can</i> set the individual steps themselves. Go figure.

<p><li>Even if you turn a macro destination, or a modmatrix destination or source OFF, you can still set its depth and button depth! Don't ask.

</ul>

<p><b>Hints</b><br>
When you edit a macro name, notice that the text field is actually a drop-down combo-box: it has all the default Hydrasynth macro names available.

<p><b>About Hydrasynth Manager Files</b><br>
ASM provides a librarian called the ASM Hydrasynth Manager.  This software saves patches in proprietary bank file formats with the extension "hydra" or "hydramulti".  Edisyn instead saves as standard sysex files, and does not read these proprietary files.  To convert them to Edisyn, you'll have to load them into your Hydrasynth, then dump them out to Edisyn.

<p><b>About the NRPN and Sysex Specs</b><br>
The Hydrasynth does not have a public sysex spec, and ASM has not been forthcoming: building Edisyn's editor necessitated completely reverse engineering it.  The Hydrasynth does have a public NRPN spec, but it missing a lot of parameters, missing a great deal of critical information, and has many errors.  You can find reverse engineered sysex protocol and patch format, along with a heavily revised NRPN spec, <a href="https://github.com/eclab/edisyn/tree/master/edisyn/synth/asmhydrasynth/info">in this directory</a>.
