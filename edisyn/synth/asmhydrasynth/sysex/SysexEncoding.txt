HYDRASYNTH SYSEX ENCODING	
[Incomplete Reverse Engineering as of March 5]

All Hydrasynth sysex messages have the same basic format:

	F0 00 20 2B 00 6F DATA... F7

00 20 2B are the namespace for Medeli, aka ASM.  00 6F are unknown but
I presume they're the ID for the Hydrasynth.

The DATA contains a PAYLOAD of 8-bit bytes encoded as Base64.

Each PAYLOAD appears to consist of four CHECKSUM BYTES followed by
the actual INFO bytes of arbitrary length.  To compute the checksum,

1. Compute the CRC-32 checksum on the INFO bytes
2. The checksum is of the form AABBCCDD.  Reverse it as DD CC BB AA.
3. Subtract each value from 0xFF.  That is, 0xFF-DD, 0xFF-CC, 0xFF-BB, 0xFF-AA
4. The resulting four bytes will be the CHECKSUM

An example INFO string is:	04 00 00 7F

I believe this means "Request Dump of Bank A Patch 128".  Following the 
instructions above, this converts into a PAYLOAD of

	19 DB 63 91 04 00 00 7F

The Base-64 encoded version of this PAYLOAD is 
	
	47 64 74 6A 6B 51 51 41 41 48 38 3D
or 	"GdtjkQQAAH8="

Inserting into the final sysex message, we have:

	F0 00 20 2B 00 6F 47 64 74 6A 6B 51 51 41 41 48 38 3D F7
