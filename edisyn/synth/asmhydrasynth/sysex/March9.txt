March 9, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

Now that we know how to download a patch, I've modified Edisyn as follows.
When you choose "Request Patch" and select a patch, Edisyn will request it,
decode the results, and then store the byte array in the variable INITIAL.
Then when you subsequently select "Request Patch", it will do the same, but
instead of storing it in INITIAL, it will compare it to INITIAL and print out
the diffs.

To use this, we can first set up INITIAL, then make a modification in one
patch parameter, save it on the Hydrasynth, and download it and compare to
INITIAL.  The diff will tell use where the Hydrasynth is storing the parameter.

From this I've begun a text file spreadsheet of apparent parameter locations.
It'll be a slow and tedious process but we'll get it done.

Some initial notes:

	- It seems that all the numerical and bitwise  parameters I've 
	  tried are stored in EVEN bytes. I wonder what's stored in the
	  ODD bytes.  Hydrasynth deluxe data?

	- Warm Mode and Snap are packed into the same byte.  Bitpacking
	  is always bad. :-(

	- The eight macro name regions are separated with nine-byte
	  "junk" regions filled with arbitrary words and fragments of
	  ASCII text.  It's almost as if there were additional macro
	  names available.  It's not clear what this junk is.  Again,
	  possibly Hydrasynth deluxe data?

	- Turning on Random Phase seemed to turn on a bunch of other stuff.
	  So does Vibrato BPM Sync.

	- Very shocking: Vibrato Rate BPM Sync ON and BPM Sync OFF seem
	  to be the same byte!  This makes no sense, as they're expressly
	  separate parameters in NRPN.
