March 25, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

Looks like we had forgotten a few parameters, or more correctly, didn't realize
they were part of the patch (assumed they were global):

Arp Clock Lock (clcklock)
Arp Enable
Arp Latch
Scale Key Lock
Scale Type
Scale Notes 2...7

These don't have NRPN parameters but do appear to have slots in the patch sysex.
