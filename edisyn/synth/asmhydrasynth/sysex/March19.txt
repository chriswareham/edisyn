March 19, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

Envelope, Ribbon, Mixer, Mutant, and Arpeggiator parameters determined.
Identified two oddities or bugs to report to ASM:

	- Ribbon Hold is a patch parameter in sysex but is ignored when 
	  loaded, and there's no NRPN

	- Envelope 2 Trigger Source 1 is fixed to Note On, but there's
	  still an NRPN (which is ignored) and a slot in the sysex.
