These beautiful waves are due to Thierry Rochebois Zic, who posted several
combined sheets of Hydrasynth waves to the Official Hydrasynth Group on
Facebook.  They are licensed here by him under the Creative Commons CC-BY
license. I have taken the original waves, cut them into 219 separate image
files, and inverted their colors.

Each image has three overlapping elements:

	- A wave name

	- A wave image in the time domain.

	- A histogram, left to right, of the amplitude of the first 24
	  harmonics in the wave.  If the fundamental is absent, the
	  histogram appears with an X.  

Waves in the same group have their wave images and histograms the same color.

The images are 0.png through 218.png corresponding to the 219 Hydrasynth waves.
