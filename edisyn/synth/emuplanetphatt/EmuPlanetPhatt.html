<h1>E-Mu Planet Phatt, Orbit, Orbit v2, Carnaval, Vintage Keys, and Vintage Keys Plus</h1>
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>E-Mu Planet Phatt</b>, both versions of the <b>Orbit</b> (9090 and V2/9095), <b>Carnaval</b>, <b>Vintage Keys</b> with or without the extension kit, and <b>Vintage Keys Plus</b>.  You will need to set a switch to indicate which one you are using (if you have a Vintage Keys with the extension kit, select Vintage Keys Plus).  If you load a sysex file or receive sysex from a machine, Edisyn will try to guess which machine it came from but may get it wrong.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set the MIDI ID to the same you'll be setting in Edisyn (typically 0).  Select a MIDI Channel to use on your synthesizer (perhaps channel 1) and set Edisyn's MIDI channel to that value.  Set the MIDI Mode to Omni or to Poly.  

<br><br><h3>Uploading Pseudo-MPE</h3>

These machines don't support MPE.  But we can fake it by pointing every single channel to the same patch and with the same settings: this can be taken advantage of by instruments such as the Linnstrument.   You need to make sure that your <b>MIDI Mode is set to "Multi"</b> to play them.

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>Unfortunately, changing individual parameters does not affect the current sound, only future notes played.

<p><li>There is no way to send an entire patch to current memory in E-Mu synthesizers.  Instead Edisyn must either dedicate a RAM patch to be a &ldquo;scratch patch&rdquo;, or it must send each parameter individually (which is slow but doesn't waste a patch).  I have elected to the second for the time being.

<p><li>If Edisyn is selecting the wrong patch, you might check to see if you have modified your synth's Program Map.  If so, you'll need to reset it to its defaults.

<p><li>You cannot request the current patch on any of these machines.

</ul>

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>

Thanks to Ray Bellis (ray@bellis.me.uk) and Austin Taylor (austin1@ataylor.ca) for extracting instrument dumps to make proper mappings possible for these machines.
