<h1>E-Mu Planet Phatt, Orbit (v1 and v2), Carnaval, Vintage Keys, and Vintage Keys Plus</h1>
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>E-Mu Planet Phatt</b>, both versions of the <b>Orbit</b> (V1 9090 and V2 9095), <b>Carnaval</b>, <b>Vintage Keys</b> with or without the extension kit, and <b>Vintage Keys Plus</b>.  You will need to set a switch to indicate which one you are using.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set the MIDI ID to the same you'll be setting in Edisyn (typically 0).  Select a MIDI Channel to use on your synthesizer (perhaps channel 1) and set Edisyn's MIDI channel to that value.  Set the MIDI Mode to Omni or to Poly.  

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>There is no way to send an entire patch to current memory in E-Mu synthesizers.  Instead Edisyn must either dedicate a RAM patch to be a &ldquo;scratch patch&rdquo;, or it must send each parameter individually (which is slow but doesn't waste a patch).  I have elected to the second for the time being.

<p><li>If Edisyn is selecting the wrong patch, you might check to see if you have modified your synth's Program Map.  If so, you'll need to reset it to its defaults.

<p><li>You cannot request the current patch on any of these machines.

</ul>

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>

Thanks to Ray Bellis (ray@bellis.me.uk) and Austin Taylor (austin1@ataylor.ca) for extracting instrument dumps to make proper mapping possible for these machines.
