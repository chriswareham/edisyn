<h1>Novation A-Station</h1>
<h2>Patch Editor - Still under development !</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Novation A-Station</b>.<br>
It is developed and tested with the latest available firmware, being '2.1.2'

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br>
Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as your synth's MIDI channel

<p><b>Other Interesting Facts</b><br>
This editor is still under development and not feature complete.<br>
On the currently-supported-features list we have:
<ul>
    <li>request current/given patch, supporting most of the parameters</li>
    <li>most of the realtime controls (CC-based) are working bidirectional</li>
    <li>NRPN-based controls are still under development</li>
</ul>
Although the UI is still limited, it's already more useful than the UI on the device ;).<br><br>

On the TODO list we have (in order of importance - IMHO):
<ul>
    <li>writing updates to the device</li>
    <li>supporting NRPN-based controls</li>
    <li>testing, testing, testing...  (the model + UI, but also interaction with global Edisyn features: merges, librarian, ...)</li>
    <li>UI extensions (supporting the whole set of parameters)</li>
    <li>UI improvement (some ideas on usability)</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b><br>
