<h1>Novation A Station</h1>
<h2>Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This is an editor for the <b>Novation A Station</b>.<br>
It is developed and tested with the latest available firmware, being "2.1.2"

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br>
Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as your synth's MIDI channel.</li>
If you want to store patches, make sure the "Global Memory Protect" is OFF on the synth.</li>

<p><b>Notes</b><br>
The A Station editor supports all basic patch + parameter handling:
<ul>
    <li>supporting realtime control (both directions)</li>
    <li>supporting all parameters (from both the hardware controls and the menu's)</li>
    <li>load current/given/next patch</li>
    <li>write to current/given path</li>
    <li>basic librarian support</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b><br>
<ul>
    <li>If you load the current patch, the A Station does not tell Edisyn what bank or number the patch is.</li>
    <p><li>Some parameters (LFO, delay, ...) have both a Dial for sync and non-sync speed.
        On the unit, the sync speed has precedence, so only if its value is "N/A" the non-sync speed is being applied
        To make that explicit in the editor the non-sync speed dial is disabled when the sync speed dial is NOT "N/A"
    </li>
</ul>
