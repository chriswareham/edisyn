<h1>Waldorf MicroWave</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Waldorf MicroWave</b> (sometimes called the "Microwave 1") only.  The MicroWave II/XT/XTk have a different editor.

<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>This one is important: Edisyn cannot change the MicroWave from Single mode to Multimode or back via sysex.  You have to do it manually on the unit.  This has a big impact when Edisyn is writing or requesting patches, because when it does so it also ask to change the patch, but this will not happen if the MicroWave is set to the wrong mode.
