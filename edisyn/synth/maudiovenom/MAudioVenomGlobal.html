<h1>M-Audio Venom</h1> 
<h2>Global Parameters Patch Editor</h2>

Normally Edisyn does not have global parameters patch editors because most are set-and-forget affairs.  There are few exceptions, but this is one: the M-Audio Venom has a number of very important parameters which cannot be set in any other way except by sysex.  So there you go.

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br>
Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as your Venom.  

<ul>
<li>To communicate with your Venom over USB, use "Venom Synth In" as the Receive From device, and "Venom Synth Out" as the Send To device.  Set the Venom up to receive MIDI events over USB by holding the Edit button, then pressing the "MIDI Out" key (the A-flat below Middle C) until the screen changes to "MIDI OUT USB".

<p><li>To communicate with your Venom over standard MIDI ports, just use the appropriate MIDI device for your computer.   Set the Venom up to receive MIDI events over 5-pin DIN MIDI cabling by holding the Edit button, then pressing the "MIDI Out" key (the A-flat below Middle C) until the screen changes to "MIDI OUT kEY".
</ul>

<p>The Venom's sysex documentation indicates that you can set the Venom's Synth ID.  But to my knowledge this does not actually exist.  If it does, please let me know.  By default Edisyn is hard-coded to use 0.

<p><b>Important Note</b><br>

One of the Venom's global parameters specifies the MIDI Out mode (USB vs Key). Changing this mode could disconnect the Venom from Edisyn, and so Edisyn does not display this parameter, nor does it upload the parameter when you send parameters to the Venom.

<p><b>Hints</b><br>

<ul>
<li>The Venom's Sustain, Expression, and Mod Wheel CC dials don't just map to Continuous Controllers (CC).  Above CC 127 they also map to:

<ul>
<li><b>PB Sens</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pitch Bend Sensitivity (RPN 0)
<li><b>F Tune</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Fine Tuning (RPN 1)
<li><b>C Tune</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Master Coarse Tuning (RPN 2)
<li><b>AT</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Channel Aftertouch (Pressure)
</ul>

</ul>

<p><b>Gotchas</b><br>

<ul>
<li>This editor deals with a global parameter region rather than a bank of patches.  But while sending to the current patch doesn't make much sense, it's important as a basic patch editor feature.  Thus when you send to the current patch, you're actually just writing (permanently) to the global region.  Likewise requesting the current patch reads from the global region.

</ul>
