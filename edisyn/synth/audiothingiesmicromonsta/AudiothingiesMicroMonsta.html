<h1>Audiothingies MicroMonsta</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p><b>Communicating with Edisyn</b><br> 
Set Edisyn's MIDI channel to the same as the synth's MIDI channel.  Set the unit to output USB or 5-pin MIDI DIN depending on how you're connecting it to your computer.  Note that you can send to current patch via USB, but you cannot read or write patches to permanent memory via USB: it must be via 5-pin DIN.  If you're connecting directly via USB, be sure to set Edisyn's incoming and outgoing MIDI Device to "MicroMonsta".  Set MIDI Out Mode to "cc".  


<p><b>Reading and Writing Patches</b><br>
The MicroMonsta has very limited sysex.  At present Edisyn can send a patch to current memory, and it can send individual parameters, but in order to read or write patches to permanent memory, you must manually set up the unit.  Edisyn cannot request patches from the MicroMonsta.

<ul>
<li><b>Writing Patches</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;To have Edisyn write a patch to the synthesizer, you have to place your MicroMonsta into Batch Sysex MIDI Receive mode.  To do this, hold down LOAD and power-cycle the unit.  When asked "Write Bank->Mem?", use the third encoder to select the location of the first patch to be written, then press LOAD (button 9).  Write the patch or patches from Edisyn.  Then press HOME to reset the unit.  This means that regardless of where Edisyn's patch editor or librarian thinks they're sending patches, they will go to the range you specified on the unit.

<p>If you're writing a single patch from the editor, you'll find it more convenient instead to Send to Current Patch, then save the patch on the MicroMonsta itself, rather than reboot the synthesizer into Batch Sysex MIDI Receive mode.

<p><li><b>Receiving Patches</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edisyn cannot request patches from the MicroMonsta.  To send a patch to Edisyn, you have to place your MicroMonsta into Batch Sysex MIDI Send mode.  To do this, hold down SAVE (SHIFT-LOAD) and power-cycle the unit.  When asked "Send Sysex Bank?", use the third encoder to select the location of the first patch to be sent to Edisyn, use the fourth encoder to select the location of the final patch to be sent to Edisyn.

<p>Next, if you're loading the patches into Edisyn's Librarian, you have to tell Edisyn where to put them because the MicroMonsta doesn't include patch location in its patches (argh).  See <b>Set Librarian Download Point</b> below in the discussion about <b>Using the Librarian</b> to learn how to do this.  If you're just loading a single patch into the editor, you don't need to bother doing this.  When you have let Edisyn know where to put the patches, press LOAD on your MicroMonsta (button 9), which will write the patch or patches from Edisyn.  

<p><li><b>Merging Patches</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's difficult (and not worth it) but not impossible to request patch merges.  Have Edisyn request a merge, and then manually place the unit into Batch Sysex MIDI Send Mode as described above and send a patch to Edisyn.

<p><li><b>Blending Patches</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly it's difficult (and not worth it) but not impossible to do a Blend.  Tell Edisyn to Blend, then manually place the unit into Batch Sysex MIDI Send Mode as described above and send two patches to Edisyn (you probably will need to put it into the Mode twice).

<p><li><b>Morphing, Nudging, and Hill-Climbing</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;It'd be much easier to do these if you loaded all the patches into the Librarian (perhaps saving them for future use), then initialized the Morpher, Hill-climber, or Nudger either from the Librarian, or by loading patches from a file.
</ul>


<p><b>Gotchas</b><br>

<ul>
<li>The MicroMonsta's patch sysex does not indicate the patch number, and Edisyn can't request patches.  This means that Edisyn has no idea what patch number a patch is.  It still displays the patch number to be consistent with patches received from the Librarian.

<p><li>The MicroMonsta's patch name characters are odd: you can have any ASCII character except for <tt>{ | } ~</tt> (the final four) for some reason.  Also for some reason the <tt> \ </tt> character is displayed as <tt>&#x00A2;</tt>.

<p><li>The MicroMonsta's sysex specification is not documented.  I have reverse engineered it, and detail the specification at the end of Edisyn's AudioThingiesMicromonsta.java file in case you're interested.
</ul>


<p><b>Using the Librarian</b><br>

The MicroMonsta's limited sysex makes using Librarian a challenge.  The MicroMonsta sends patches to Edisyn one at a time, but these patches do not indicate which patch number they are; and furthermore Edisyn can't <i>request</i> patches from the MicroMonsta, so it can't prepare a patch number in advance.  In short, when the patches show up, Edisyn's librarian has no idea where to put them.

<p>To deal with this, the MicroMonsta editor has a special menu option: <b>Set Librarian Download Point</b>.  It works like this.  You open the Librarian and select a patch location.  Then you select Set Librarian Download Point.  Now when a patch comes in, Edisyn will place it in this patch location, and then increment the download point to the next patch location, wrapping around if need be.  

<p>Also when you load from disk, Edisyn will load starting at the set download point.

<p>If you don't set a download point, Edisyn will assume you're loading from patch number 0.

<p>Note that setting the Download point has no effect on what happens if you load a patch directly into the editor: in this case, Edisyn still has no idea what number to use, so it'll just set it to 0.
