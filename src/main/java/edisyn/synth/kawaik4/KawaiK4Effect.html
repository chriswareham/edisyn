<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Effect Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.


<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28

<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".  
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>
<li>There's a bug in the Kawai K4 Sysex documentation which I have not yet resolved.  If you change the PAN value of a submix, you'll notice it goes from -7 to +7, then "??", then I1 to I6.  The "??" reflects a value which should not exist.  I do not have a K4r, and so cannot determine the proper setting of this value.

<p><li>When you update a parameter, it's not reflected on the K4's LCD until you move to something else and back again.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Librarian Support</h3>

Effect patches don't have names.  This can be very confusing when writing and downloading banks.  For example, if you copy Internal04 to the slot of Internal01 (which is slot 1), then re-download it, it'll come back as Internal01!  This is because, lacking a patch name, when Edisyn receives the patch, it has to come up with a name for it, and just uses the slot number.

<p>When Edisyn attempts to download the External bank, and you don't have a card in your K4, the K4 will simply ignore requests from Edisyn.  This wil make it look like Edisyn is hanging: just stop the download.

<p>Edisyn can quick-request a bank from this synthesizer via <b>Request Bank from Synth</b>.  This is a lot faster than the patch-by-patch request method in <b>Download Bank from Synth</b>.  So try it out.
