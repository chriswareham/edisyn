<h1>Kawai K4</h1> 
<h2>Single Patch Editor</h2>

<p>This editor will work with the <b>Kawai K4</b> and the <b>Kawai K4r</b>.

<br><br><h3>Communicating with Edisyn</h3>

Set your K4 to receive Program Changes (RCV PGM = NORM) and Exclusive (RCV EXCL = ON).  See pages 79 and 80 of the manual.  You'll also probably want your send channel and receive channel to be the same.  I wouldn't set the receive channel to OMNI, as this might conflict with drums.

<br><br><h3>K4 Banks</h3>

You'd think that the "A, B, C, D" buttons on the K4 designate four banks.  But they don't.  For purposes of sysex (and for Edisyn's purposes) the K4 only has two banks: internal and external, each with 64 patches.  Edisyn designates the "A, B, C, D" as so-called <b>groups</b>.


<br><br><h3>Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>The following effect patches are not used by any standard single, multi, or drum patch:  3, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 21, 22, 23, 28
<p><li>In all standard effect patches, Submix H is always "off".
<p><li>The K4's documentation regarding filter envelopes is wrong.  A filter envelope's strength is multiplied by the envelope depth, and then the whole thing is added to the primary filter cutoff.  A filter envelope starts at 0, rises to maximum attack, then decays to the sustain level (which can be above or below 0!), then finally releases back to 0.   This means that the cutoff starts at the base cutoff value, then rises to some higher value, decays to a sustain possibly <i>below</i> the base cutoff value, then returns the base cutoff on release.  Furthermore, the envelope depth can be inverted, so attacks can go down rather than up.
</ul>


<br><br><h3>Gotchas</h3>

<ul>

<li>[Mute is not called "mute", but rather the opposite: "on".]  You can't send mute as a simple parameter change.  As a result, Edisyn will do a full send to current patch when you change mute.  

<p><li>When you update a parameter, it's not reflected on the K4's LCD until you move to something else and back again.  Also when you send a patch, the name isn't updated: but the sound has in fact been changed.

<p><li>When in Normal or Twin, resonance only goes 0...3.
</ul>

<br><br><h3>Librarian Support</h3>

When Edisyn attempts to download the External bank, and you don't have a card in your K4, the K4 will simply ignore requests from Edisyn.  This wil make it look like Edisyn is hanging: just stop the download.

<p>Edisyn can quick-request a bank from this synthesizer via <b>Request Bank from Synth</b>.  This is a lot faster than the patch-by-patch request method in <b>Download Bank from Synth</b>.  So try it out.

<br><br><h3>Thanks</h3>
