March 26, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

Additional arp and scale parametes verified, more or less.  The custom-edit
scale notes will be a problem because the Hydrasynth internally sorts them by
note value (which makes sense) but appears to retain them out of order even
after multiple edits.  That's going to be a mess.  At present Edisyn just keeps
them out of order, which will be inconsistent with the Hydrasynth for the time
being.

Also determined that what I had thought might be "Enabled" flags for the Macros
actually are categories for the destinations (like "Arp" or "Filter 1").
Edisyn doesn't need these, but it's not clear yet if the Hydrasynth will require
them to be set properly.  We'll find out soon enough.
