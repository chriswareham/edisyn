March 14, 2023 Hydrasynth sysex reverse engineering notes.

When the Hydrasynth Manager first connects with the Hydrasynth, it 
performs the following handshake:

->	00 00

<-	01 00 41 3A 42 3A 43 3A 44 3A 45 00

->	28 00

<-	29 00 9B 00 01

->  	[The sysex string]   F0 00 20 2B 00 6F 01 F7

The first two appear to be a handshake (they're done below as well).
The remainder, I dunno.  Version information?  I'm on 1.5.5, Serial Number
9510018. That would be 01 29 B3 02 so I don't think it's leaking the serial
number.  I note that 41 3A 42 3A 43 3A 44 3A 45 is an interesting sequence.
I also note that it is quite strange to find that "155" is 9B.  So 
29 00 9B 00 01 is probably version info.  Not sure what 01 is.


When requesting patch names from the Hydrasynth, it does the following:

->	00 00

<-	01 00 41 3A 42 3A 43 3A 44 3A 45 00

->	18 00

<-	19 00

-> 	02 00 00	
	Presumably "Request Patch Names Bank 00".  When requesting Bank B,
	it does 02 00 01.

So this implies that the patch data from March 8 actually starts 4 more
deep, or perhaps 8 deep (thus it starts at Category maybe).
